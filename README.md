Hello, I am a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/research-fellows-program-at-microsoft-research-india/) at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) in Bangalore, India, with a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from [Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad](http://www.mnnit.ac.in/). My career has prominently featured roles in software engineering and data science, notably at [Myntra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myntra), One of India's largest fashion e-commerce brand, where I spearheaded initiatives to optimize machine learning systems for scalable product recommendations and search functionalities.

Currently, I am involved in pioneering [Programming with Representations (PwR)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/pwr/) at Microsoft Research, which aims to redefine software development through generative AI. This work allows me to blend my expertise in AI with software development, pushing the boundaries of how software solutions are crafted and delivered.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I am passionate about historical and geographical studies, which provide me with a broad perspective on the world and its diverse cultures. I actively share knowledge and engage with the tech community through educational initiatives and discussions.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn for collaboration or to exchange ideas.
