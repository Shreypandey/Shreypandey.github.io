      institution: <b><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/">Microsoft Research</a></b>
      year: Jan 2024 - present
      location: Bengaluru, India
      maindescription: Working on Programming with Representations which is a software development approach that relies on a domain-specific language (DSL), or representation, defined by a developer specializing in a specific domain. This representation includes built-in guardrails that are automatically implemented throughout the software development process. Once a representation is defined for a domain, PwR enables any developer interested in that domain to translate their intentions using natural language into a program in that representation.

        - title: <b>Personalised Search Ranking</b>
          contents: 
            - Designed and developed a real-time, user-personalised search-ranking service, using long-term and short-term user features, query relevance, product attributes and dynamic product features in an XGBoost model optimised for CTR.
            - Engineered a high-performance solution for millions of users and products, leveraging Aerospike data store, SIMD-based cosine similarity processing, and ONNX Runtime for XGBoost model inferencing, delivering seamless operation at <b>500K RPM</b> with a remarkable <b>P99 latency of 30ms</b>.
            - Proven positive impact on business metrics through AB tests, enhancing user experience and relevance at scale.
        - title: <b>Recommendation System</b>
          contents:
            - Engineered a versatile framework for real-time product recommendations, leveraging embedding-based features and MCDA to optimize for relevance, personalization, and real-time business metrics, and using Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) to incorporate diversity in the recommendations.
            - Scaled the system to handle throughput of <b>5M RPM</b> with a <b>P99 latency of 40ms</b>, achieving a <b>19x latency reduction</b> and an <b>88% annual hardware cost savings</b> compared to the previous system.
        - title: <b>Machine Learning Scaling</b>
          contents:
            -  Built reusable components for scaling data science models by optimizing for latency and throughput. Maintaining compatibility by python, aligning with preferences of data scientists and easy to use with minimal code changes. Proposed solutions have been adopted to improve multiple data science services at Myntra.
            -  Engineered a memory-efficient solution, consolidating embedding vectors in shared memory to <b>reduce latency by 4.5x</b> and <b>reduce memory footprint by 6x</b>. Enhanced application throughput per node by enabling more worker processes per node.
            -  Introduced a high-performance approach using SIMD for calculating similarity scores and re-ranking, drastically cutting computation cycles and latency. The method handles up to <b>15x more traffic</b> while improving latency.
        - title: <b>Image Pose Detector</b>
          contents:
            -  Created an scalable online service for human pose detection from an image using a ResNet-18 model with custom layers. 
            -  Able to handle <b>27x more throughput</b> with a <b>6x reduction in latency</b> from its predecessor on a single node.
